# Deep Learning for Speech and Language

## Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya


The aim of this course is to train students in methods of deep learning for speech and language. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) will be presented and analyzed in detail to understand the potential of these state of the art tools for time series processing. Engineering tips and scalability issues will be addressed to solve tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, speech synthesis or question answering. Hands-on sessions will provide development skills so that attendees can become competent in contemporary data anlaytics tools.
